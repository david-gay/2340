# Crowdsourcing Freshwater

----
## Motivation
Our project this semester supports the Georgia Tech Serve/Learn/Sustain program. More details on this program are [here](ï¿¼http://serve-learn-sustain.gatech.edu/welcome). It is loosely based on the NASA challenge [here](https://2015.spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/clean-water-mapping/).

Specifically, in our class CS 2340, we will create an application that supports finding clean drinking water and reporting on testing results. In many parts of the world, access to clean water is a severe problem. Many times, water is available, but people do not know where to get it. Other times, water may appear clean, but has unacceptable levels of contaminants.

Even in areas where there is a lack of clean water, the population has access to devices on which applications can run. Most of these devices are smart phones, so we are creating an Android application to provide this functionality.

Our application will allow water reporting to crowd sourced. People can report on locations where water is available. Users of the application can find the nearest water source or report on a new water source. Workers with test kits will also be able to report on contaminant levels. The application will provide historical graphs to show variations in water quality over time for a specific location.

A normal application like this would be networked and have a database backend. For this class, those skills are not pre-requisites, so our application will be simulated multi-user. We will assume all the data will fit into memory, so that you may store data in an appropriate basic data structure. We will persist (save the data) to disk. Making an actual networked application with a database is extra credit.
